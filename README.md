## **AI Audio Surveillance for Public Safety ðŸš¨**

This project is an AI-powered surveillance system designed to enhance campus safety while maintaining energy efficiency. It integrates **microphones, vibration sensors, and AI models** to detect abnormal sounds like screams, gunshots, and breaking glass. When an emergency is identified, the system **triggers LED alerts, sends SMS notifications, and calls emergency lines** to ensure a rapid response.

Built on **Raspberry Pi and Arduino**, the system processes real-time audio and vibration data using AI-based classification models like **DeepSpeech or Whisper**. It operates efficiently with a **Sleep Mode Display** to conserve energy, making it a **reliable and proactive security solution for public spaces**.
